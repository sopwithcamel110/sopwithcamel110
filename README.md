## About Me
Currently at [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/) planning to graduate in '24 with a B.S. in Computer Science. Aside from coding, I enjoy working out, cooking, and playing volleyball for my school's club. 

## My coding experience
I started programming at 8 years old through [Roblox Studio](https://www.roblox.com/create). My first coding language was C++, followed by Python, which I learned through taking summer camps at [ID Tech](https://www.idtech.com/) during my summers in middle and high school. Since then I have continued my studies through university courses and self-teaching. Today, my best coding languages are Python, JS, C++, and Java. 

## What am I most proud of?
I am most proud of the two web apps I developed recently, Visualized Sorting Algorithms and ReAInvent. The first is a React webpage that takes any input and shows the sorting process with a variety of algorithms, and ReAInvent is a tool that takes a YouTube link and trains a chatbot to answer any question you have about the content within the video and gives timestamps. Check it out [here.](https://reainvent.com)

## What am I currently working on?
I'm currently working on the front end of ReAInvent and hosting it with Nginx on a Google Cloud VM.
