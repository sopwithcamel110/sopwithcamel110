## About Me
Currently at [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/) planning to graduate in '24 with a B.S. in Computer Science. Aside from coding, I enjoy working out, cooking, and playing volleyball for my school's club. 

## My coding experience
I started programming at 8 years old through [Roblox Studio](https://www.roblox.com/create). My first coding language was C++, followed by Python, which I learned through taking summer camps at [ID Tech](https://www.idtech.com/) during my summers in middle and high school. Since then I have continued my studies through university courses and self-teaching. Today, my best coding languages are Python, Go, C++, and Java. 

## What am I most proud of?
I am most proud of the two games I developed in Unity C#, Purge of the Undead and I Gotta Escape. The first is a 3D Open World shooter game, and the second is an infinite generation platformer using custom assets.

## What am I currently working on?
I'm currently studying data structures and sorting algorithms to better my understanding of foundational programming concepts. I would like to sharpen my JS skills by creating an interactive API to showcase this knowledge in the future.
